# JavaScript Projects Portfolio

Hi, I'm Gulshan 👋  
I am currently learning **Full Stack Development** and building projects to strengthen my fundamentals in **JavaScript, DOM, APIs, and React**.

These projects were built during my learning journey and focus on understanding logic, UI, and real-world concepts step by step.
