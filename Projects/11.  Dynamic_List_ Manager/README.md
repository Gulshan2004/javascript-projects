# Dynamic List Manager

A Dynamic List Manager built using **HTML and JavaScript** that allows users to add items to a list and delete them dynamically.

## Features
- Add items to a list
- Delete individual items
- Input validation
- Dynamic UI rendering
- Efficient event handling using event delegation

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript

## How It Works
1. The user enters text in the input field.
2. Clicking the Add button pushes the value into an array.
3. The UI is re-rendered to display the updated list.
4. Each item includes a delete button with a `data-index` attribute.
5. Event delegation is used on the list to handle delete actions efficiently.
